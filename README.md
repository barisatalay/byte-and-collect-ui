## Quickstart

https://baris-atalay.gitbook.io/untitled/

First at all, you need to open up hardhat node or something else

```
yarn

```

> **PLEASE USE A METAMASK ACCOUNT THAT ISNT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY REAL MONEY.**
> Additionally, add your localhost with chainid 31337 to your metamask.

Then, back in your first terminal, run:

```
yarn dev
```

### Important localhost note

If you use metamask with a local network, everytime you shut down your node, you'll need to reset your account. Settings -> Advanced -> Reset account. Don't do this with a metamask you have real funds in.
